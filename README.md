## 初始化指导

1.  点击 [这个链接](https://github.com/EasonQYS/fastpagesJupyter/generate)生成一个自己的仓库（repository，repo），用于运行博客。  随意给仓库起名字，但是 **请勿使用** {your-username}.github.io.

2. **GitHub Actions 会自动拉取请求（Pull Request，PR）**  ~ ，大约30s完成。  完成后会在你的仓库有一个README.md文档，根据那里的指导继续操作。

想要看视频指导，可以访问这个YouTube网址，但是国内看不了。 [video tutorial of setting up a fastpages blog](https://youtu.be/L0boq3zqazI) by Abdul Majed. 当然，根据文字指导也没有问题。

3.  你或许会收到一封指导邮件，但由于邮件是英文的，你可以忽视邮件，按以下指导操作。

  3.1  生成SSH密钥对。访问[这里](https://8gwifi.org/sshfunctions.jsp)，选择RSA和4096，点击生成（Generate-SSH-Keys），就会可到两串字符。

  3.2  设置仓库（repo）的Secrets。在当前仓库地址后加/settings/secrets，或者访问settings>secrets，点击添加new secret。复制3.1中的Private Key至Value栏，包含"---BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY---" and "--END RSA PRIVATE KEY---"。在Name栏填写SSH_DEPLOY_KEY（只能是这个名字）。

  3.3  设置仓库（repo）的deploy key。在当前仓库地址后加/settings/keys，或者访问settings>Deploy keys，点击添加deploy key。复制3.1中的Public Key至key栏，name栏随意填写。请注意勾选`Allow write access`。点击Add key保存设置。
  
  3.4  启用网站。点击[这里](/settings)找到GitHub Pages，source选择gh-pages branch（如果没有可以先选择其他项，稍后自动生成gh-pages branch后可以再修改）。等待一段时间，GitHub Pages栏生成一个网址，点击即可访问该网站。

4.  修改_config.yml。需要修改的部分已经在文档内用中文标注。

5.  完成后等待约10分钟，网站自动建立成功。如果之前branch选择不是gh-pages，现在需要更改为gh-pages。



## 编写博客

### 编写表头

[表头](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) 允许你设置博客的很多属性。

在Jupyter中，表头是文档中的第一个单元个。并且是markdown格式的单元格。内容如下（可以缺省）：

  ```markdown
  # "标题"
  > "概要"
  
  - toc: true
  - badges: true
  - comments: true
  - categories: [fastpages, jupyter]
  - image: images/some_folder/your_image.png
  - author: A & B
  ```

类似的, 在一个markdown文档中，也需要表头。内容如下：

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "标题"
  summary: "概要"
  toc: true
  comments: true
  image: images/some_folder/your_image.png
  categories: [fastpages, jupyter]
  ---
  ```
注意这里的代码是以YAML格式写的，必须保证正确。

更多[YAML指导](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/)请看这里。

### 编写其他内容
  正常编写即可。



### Enabling Comments

Blog posting is powered by [Utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances), an open-source and ad-free way of implementing comments.  All comments are stored in issues on your blog's GitHub repo.  You can turn this on setting `comments` to  `true`.  This defaults to `false`.

To enable comments with [Utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) you will need to do the following:

  - Make sure the repo is public, otherwise your readers will not be able to view the issues/comments.
  - Make sure the [utterances app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) is installed on the repo, otherwise users will not be able to post comments.
  - If your repo is a fork, navigate to it's settings tab and confirm the issues feature is turned on.

### Setting an Image For Social Media

On social media sites like Twitter, an image preview can be automatically shown with your URL.  Specifying the front matter `image` provides this metadata to social media sites to render this image for you.  You can set this value as follows:

`- image: images/diagram.png`

Note: for this setting **you can only reference image files and folders in the `/images` folder of your repo.**

### Hiding A Blog Post

You may want to prevent a blog post from being listed on the home page, but still have a public url that you can preview or share discreetly.  You can hide a blog post from the home page by setting the front matter `hide` to `true`.  This is set to `false` by default.

It is recommended that you use [permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) in order to generate a predictable url for hidden blog posts.  You can also set the front matter `search_exclude` to `false` if you don't want users to find your hidden post in a search.

### Pinning A Blog Post

By default, posts are sorted by date on your homepage. However you may want one or more blog posts to always appear at the very top of your homepage.  In otherwords, you may want certain posts to be "pinned" or "sticky".  To accomplish this, specify the `sticky_rank` front matter in the order you would like your sticky posts to appear.  Blog posts that do not set this parameter are sorted in the default way by date after the sticky posts.

For example, consider these three markdown posts

`2020-01-01-Post-One.md`
```yaml
---
title: Post One
sticky_rank: 1
---
```

`2020-02-01-Post-Two.md`
```yaml
---
title: Post Two
sticky_rank: 2
---
```

`2020-04-01-Post-Three.md`
```yaml
---
title: Post Three
---
```

However, since `sticky_rank` is specified, blog posts will **first be sorted by sticky_rank in ascending order, then by date in descending order**, so the order of these posts will appear like so:

- Post One
- Post Two
- Post Three

_Note: without `sticky_rank` the above posts would actually be sorted in reverse order due to the dates associated with each post._

### Toggle Search Visibility

fastpages comes with built in keyword search powered by [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).  You can prevent a blog post or page from appearing in search results by setting the front matter `search_exclude` to `false`.  This is set to `true` by default.


## Site Wide Configuration Options

**It is recommended that everyone personalizes their blogging site by setting site-wide configration options**. These options can be found in `/_config.yml`.  Below is a description of various options that are available.

- `title`: this is the title that appears on the upper left hand corner on the header of all your pages.  
- `description`: this description will show up in various places when a preview for your site is generated (for example, on social media).
- `github_username`: this allows your site to display a link to your GitHub page in the footer.
- `github_repo`: this allows your site to render links back to your repository for various features such as links to GitHub and Colab for notebooks.
- `url`: This does not need to be changed unless you have a custom domain.  **Note: leave out the trailing / from this value.**
- `baseurl`: See the comments in `/_config.yml` for instructions ( "Special Instructions for baseurl" on setting this value properly.  If you do not have a custom domain, then you can likely ignore this option.
- `email`: this is currently unused.  Ignore.
- `twitter_username`: creates a link in your footer to your twitter page.
- `use_math`: Set this to `true` to get LaTeX math equation support.  This is off by default as it otherwhise loads javascript into each page that may not be used.
- `show_description`: This shows a description under the title of your blog posts on your homepage that contains a list of your blog posts.  Set to `true` by default.
- `google_analytics`: Optionally use a [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) ID for tracking if desired. 
- `show_image`: If set to true, this uses the `image` parameter in the front matter of your blog posts to render a preview of your blogs as shown below.  This is set to `false` by default.
  When show_image is set to `true` your homepage will look like this:

  ![home page](/_fastpages_docs/_show_image_true.png)

- `show_tags`: You can toggle the display of tags on your blog posts on or off by setting this value to `false`.  This is set to `true` by default, which which renders the following links for tags on your blog posts like this:

  ![tags](_fastpages_docs/_post_tags.png)

- `pagination`: This is the maximum number of posts to show on each page of your home page.  Any posts exceeding this amount will be paginated onto another page.  This is set to `15` by default.  When this is triggered, you will see pagination at the bottom of your home page appear like this:

  ![paginate](_fastpages_docs/_paginate.png)

  Note: if you are using an older version of fastpages, **you cannot use the automated upgrade process** to get pagination.  Instead you must follow these steps:

    1. Rename your index.md file to index.html 
         > mv index.md index.html
    2. Replace the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` in the root of your repo with the files in this repo.
    3. Edit your `_config.yml` as follows (look at [_config.yml](_config.yml) for an example):
        ```yaml
        gems:
        - jekyll-paginate

        paginate: 10
        paginate_path: /page:num/
        ```

    _Alternatively, you can copy all of your posts over to a newly created  repository created from the fastpages template._

- `default_badges`: By default GitHub, Binder, and Colab badges will show up on notebook blog posts. You can adjust these defaults by setting the appropriate value in `default_badges` to false.  For example, if you wanted to turn Binder badges off by default, you would change `default_badges` to this:

  ```yaml
  default_badges:
    github: true
    binder: false
    colab: true
  ```

## Syntax Highlighting

`fastpages` overrides the default syntax highlighting of minima with the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/).  

- The default highlighting in fastpages looks like this:

  ![default-highlighting](_fastpages_docs/highlight_dracula.png)

- However, you can make the syntax highlighting to look like this, if you choose:

  ![default-highlighting](_fastpages_docs/highlight_original.png)

  If you wish to revert to the light theme above, you can remove the below line in [_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss](_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss)

  ```scss
  @import "minima/fastpages-dracula-highlight"; 
  ```
- If you don't like either of these themes, you can add your own CSS in [`_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss`](_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss).  See [customizing fastpages](#customizing-fastpages) for more details.

## Writing Blog Posts With Jupyter

### Hide Input/Output Cells

Place the comment `#hide` at the beginning of a code cell and it wil **hide both the input and the output** of that cell.

A `#hide_input` comment at the top of any cell will **only hide the input**.

Furthermore, the `hide input` [Jupyter Extension](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/hide_input/readme.html) can be used to hide cell inputs or outputs, which will be respected by fastpages.

### Collapsable Code Cells

You may want some code to be hidden in a collapsed element that the user can expand, rather than completely hiding the code from the reader.

- To include code in a collapsable cell that **is collapsed by default**, place the comment `#collapse` at the top of the code cell.
- To include code in a collapsable cell that **is open by default**, place the comment `#collapse_show` or `#collapse-show` at the top of the code cell.

### Embedded Twitter and YouTube Content
In a markdown cell in your notebook, use the following markdown shortcuts to embed Twitter cards and YouTube Videos.


  ```markdown
  > youtube: https://youtu.be/your-link
  > twitter: https://twitter.com/some-link
  ```
### Adding Footnotes

Adding footnotes in notebooks is a bit different than markdown.  Please the [Detailed Guide To Footnotes in Notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/blob/master/_fastpages_docs/NOTEBOOK_FOOTNOTES.md).

### Automatically Convert Notebooks To Blog Posts

1. Save your notebook with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.` into the `/_notebooks` or `/_word` folder of this repo, respectively.  For example `2020-01-28-My-First-Post.ipynb`.  This [naming convention is required by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) to render your blog post.
    - Be careful to name your file correctly!  It is easy to forget the last dash in `YYYY-MM-DD-`. Furthermore, the character immediately following the dash should only be an alphabetical letter.  Examples of valid filenames are:

        ```shell
        2020-01-28-My-First-Post.ipynb
        2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.ipynb
        ```

     - If you fail to name your file correctly, `fastpages` will automatically attempt to fix the problem by prepending the last modified date of your file to your generated blog post, however, it is recommended that you name your files properly yourself for more transparency.


2. [Commit and push](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) your file(s) to GitHub in your repository's master branch.

3. GitHub will automatically convert your files to blog posts.  **It will take ~5 minutes for the conversion process to take place**.  You can click on the Actions tab of your repo to view the logs of this process. There will be two workflows that are triggered with each push you make to your master branch: (1) "CI" and (2) "GH Pages Status".  Both workflows must complete with a green checkmark for your latest commit before your site is updated.

4. If you wish, you can preview how your blog will look locally before commiting to GitHub. See [this section](#running-the-blog-on-your-local-machine) for a detailed guide on running the preview locally.


## Writing Blog Posts With Markdown

If you are writing your blog post in markdown, save your `.md` file into the `/_posts` folder with the same naming convention (`YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`) specified for notebooks.

## Writing Blog Posts With Microsoft Word

Save your Microsoft Word documents into the `/_word` folder with the same naming convention (`YYYY-MM-DD-*.docx`) specified for notebooks.

_Note:_ [alt text](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-alternative-text-to-a-shape-picture-chart-smartart-graphic-or-other-object-44989b2a-903c-4d9a-b742-6a75b451c669) in Word documents are not yet supported by fastpages, and will break links to images.

### Specifying front-matter for Word documents

`fastpages` does not have a robust way to specify [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) for Word documents.  At the moment, you can only specify front matter globablly for all Word documents by editing [_action_files/word_front_matter.txt](_action_files/word_front_matter.txt).  

To specify unique front matter per Word document, you will need to convert Word to markdown files manually. You can follow the steps in this [blog post](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/18/gitblog/), which walk you through how to use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to do the conversion.  Note: If you wish to customize your Word generated blog post in markdown, make sure you delete your Word document from the _word directory so your markdown file doesn’t get overwritten!  

_If your primary method of writing blog posts is Word documents, and you plan on always manually editing markdown files converted from Word, you are probably better off using [fast_template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template) instead of fastpages._

# Running the blog on your local machine

See the [development guide](_fastpages_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).


# Using The GitHub Action & Your Own Custom Blog

The `fastpages` action allows you to convert notebooks from `/_notebooks` and word documents from `/_word` directories in your repo into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) compliant blog post markdown files located in `/_posts`.  **Note: This directory structure is currently inflexible** for this Action, as it is designed to be used with Jekyll.

If you already have sufficient familiarity with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and wish to use this automation in your own theme,  you can use this GitHub Action by referencing `fastai/fastpages@master` as follows:

```yaml
...

uses: fastai/fastpages@master

...
```
An illustrative example of what a complete workflow may look like:



```yaml
jobs:
  build-site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ...

    - name: convert notebooks and word docs to posts
      uses: fastai/fastpages@master

    ...

    - name: Jekyll build
      uses: docker://jekyll/jekyll
      with:
        args: jekyll build

    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      if: github.event_name == 'push'
      with:
        deploy_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }}
        publish_branch: gh-pages
        publish_dir: ./_site
```

Note that this Action **does not have any required inputs, and has no output variables**.  

### Optional Inputs

  - `BOOL_SAVE_MARKDOWN`:  Either 'true' or 'false'.  Whether or not to commit converted markdown files from notebooks and word documents into the _posts directory in your repo.  This is useful for debugging. _default: false_
  - `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY`: a ssh deploy key is required if BOOL_SAVE_MARKDOWN = 'true'

See the API spec for this action in [action.yml](action.yml)

Detailed instructions on how to customize this blog are beyond the scope of this README.  ( We invite someone from the community to contribute a blog post on how to do this in this repo! )

# FAQ

- **Q:** Where are the markdown files in `_posts/` that are generated from my Jupyter notebooks or word documents?  **A:** The GitHub Actions workflow in this repo converts your notebook and word documents to markdown on the fly before building your site, but never commits these intermediate markdown files to this repo.  This is in order to save you from the annoyance of your local environment being constantly out of sync with your repository.  You can optionally see these intermediate markdown files by setting the `BOOL_SAVE_MARKDOWN` and `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` inputs to the fastpages action in your `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
    ...

    - name: convert notebooks and word docs to posts
      uses: fastai/fastpages@master
      with:
        BOOL_SAVE_MARKDOWN: true
        SSH_DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }}

    ...
```

- **Q:** Can I use `fastpages` for Jekyll docs sites or for things that are not Jekyll blog posts?  **A:** At the moment, `fastpages` is a highly opinionated solution that works only for Jekyll blog posts.  If you want to write documentation for your module or library with Jupyter notebooks, we suggest you use [fastai/nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) which is expressly built for this purpose.

- **Q:** What is the difference between [fast_template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template) and fastpages?  Which one should I use?  **A:** Because `fastpages` is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. `fast_template` may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github's integrated online editor.

# Customizing Fastpages

fastpages builds upon the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).  If you want to customize the styling or layout of fastpages, you can find instructions [in minima's README](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/README.md).  It is a good idea to read the full contents of the README to understand the directory structure.  Furthermore, it is a good idea to have a basic understanding of Jekyll before customizing your theme.  For those new to Jekyll, [the official docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) are a good place to start.  Concretely, you can override css in fastpages in `_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss`.

**If you choose to make customizations to fastpages**  It is possible that customizations you make could collide with current or future versions of fastpages and we recommend doing so only if you feel sufficiently comfortable with HTML and CSS.
